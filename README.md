# Juice-Bar Blog

## Description

This project is a blog where you can go to write about tech. The CMS website allows you to log-in, then once you are logged in you can do things like create a blog, write comments on existing blogs, or you can log out.
The motivation for this project was that I wanted a place where I could easily organize my experiences and endeavors into programming. This seemed like the most logical place to catalog my experiences.


## Installation

There are no steps necessary to installing my app. All you need to do is visit my live website here: https://juice-bar-09-21-2022.herokuapp.com 

## Usage

Once you follow the link to my website, you will be prompted to log-in with a username and password. Once you have logged in, the splash page will load where you can see all the existing blogs, and you can click on them to see a more in-depth view of the blog. Once you are on the in-depth view of the blog, you can leave a comment by clicking on the "leave a comment" button. once you hit submit, your comment will be saved. You can click on "logout" at the top of the screen to logout of the website.
